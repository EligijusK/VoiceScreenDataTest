If python in environment doesn't work create new environment

There are one library that is from GitHub
installation guide for custom library:

1. open terminal in environment
2. In terminal navigate to folder library (pycochleagram)
3. install library in environment with this command: python setup.py install

Install all libraries from win-requirements.txt
example: pip install certifi==2021.10.8
I need mention one more things when installing libraries if it is possible install torch library with cuda

Setup server and test it self:

2. fetch and pull everything with git lfs
3. If server environment doesn't work create new venv for server
4. install libraries for server
5. launch server
6. start app.py
