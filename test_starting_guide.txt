If python in environment doesn't work create new environment with: python -m venv env

There are one library that is from GitHub
installation guide for custom library:

1. open terminal in environment
2. In terminal navigate to folder library (pycochleagram): cd pycochleagram
3. install library in environment with this command: python setup.py install

Install all libraries from win-requirements.txt
example: pip install certifi==2021.10.8
I need mention one more things when installing libraries if it is possible install torch library with cuda

Setup server and test it self:

2. fetch and pull everything with git lfs
3. If server environment doesn't work create new venv for server
4. install libraries for server
5. launch server
6. start app.py

If there will be error in base_stripped_network.py find 40, 41 line and change this:

        else:
            state = torch.load(path_weights)
            self.model.load_state_dict(state["state_model"])

TO:

        else:
            state = torch.load(path_weights, map_location=self.device)
            self.model.load_state_dict(state["state_model"])
